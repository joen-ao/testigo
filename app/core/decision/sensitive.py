"""Which agent actions are sensitive (F3 §3b, decision R4).

Wonder hands us clicks with coordinates, not "confirm the order". A click is sensitive when it
lands inside the box SAM returns for one of the protected buttons on that very
screenshot. Decided from pixels only: never from the DOM or a data-testid, which
an attacker could rename while leaving the button looking the same.

Only sensitive actions run the full pixel check (F4-F6); the rest are logged and
executed, so cost and latency grow only on the steps that matter.
