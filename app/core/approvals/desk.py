"""F7: the approval desk inside the interceptor service.

The loop runs in its own process. When an order confirmation needs the person, its
`ServiceApprover` opens the approval here and waits; the interface (view 5)
records the person reading the total and the destination aloud, the service has it
transcribed (Voice Transcribe) and compared — with `voice_match` — against the
amount and address **read from the pixels** in the approval.requested event.
Only a voice that matches unlocks "Approve"; "Deny" is always possible. The
loop then emits approval.granted with method "voice" and the real transcript.

Voice confirms the intent (how much is ordered and where it is delivered). It does not prove who is
speaking; a passkey would, and it is optional and not used (R8).

The desk holds one approval at a time, in memory, and decides nothing on its
own: it records what was heard and what the person clicked.
