"""Explain an unsupervised run after it ended (view 3), observe only.

  .venv/bin/python -m app.runtime.loop.run --scenario a2 --no-supervisor --explain

Without TESTIGO+ the pixel channel never runs, so view 3 has no region to show
where the attack text was. With `--explain`, once the run is over, the pixel
channel and the code-vs-pixels comparison (app.core.decision.engine.Interceptor.explain)
run ONCE on the frame where the agent confirmed the order (or the last frame
an action ran on, or the last frame seen), and one `explain.result` event says
what they found: the instruction-like lines on each side, the regions, and a
box around each painted line (SamSparkChannel.locate_text).

It never blocks, never changes the run, its outcome.json or WitnessBench (which
never passes --explain), and the event says `after_run: true`.
