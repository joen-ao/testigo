"""Approval: voice confirms the intent; a passkey would prove it is the person.

The loop asks an `Approver` when the interceptor says an order confirmation needs approval.
Offline, `AutoApprover` grants (the happy path) and `DenyApprover` refuses.

Real runs use `ServiceApprover` (F7 with R8): the approval opens in the
interface (view 5), the person reads the total and the destination aloud, Voice
Transcribe transcribes it, the service compares it with the amount and
address read from the pixels, and only then can the person click Approve.
Voice decides *what*. The passkey (*who*) is optional under R8 and not used;
`WebAuthnApprover` stays a stub. `ConsoleApprover` is the terminal fallback.
