"""The four checks behind `testigo verify`.

  1. policy      the receipt's policy_sha256 equals the signed policy's hash
  2. signature   the Ed25519 signature is valid for the receipt body
  3. approved    each approved crop file hashes to the recorded approved hash
  4. executed    what executed equals what was approved (and its crop files
                 hash to the recorded executed hashes)

Check 4 is where a changed address shows up: an honest, correctly-signed
receipt of a *caught* attack passes 1-3 and fails 4 ("Evidence mismatch at
step 4", View 7b). A tampered receipt fails 2.

Step 4 recomputes the comparison from the signed values, never trusting the
recorded verdict: from the text read from each crop when the receipt has it
(`read`), else from crop-hash equality (older receipts, examples/). A `blocked`
receipt has no executed side, so step 4 does not apply (F9-D4); a confirmed one
with nothing captured after the click fails step 4 as not recorded.

Every recorded hash must be a 64-char lowercase hex sha256, and the crop names
must be exactly amount and address (approved always; executed when it is not
null); a missing hash never "matches" a missing file. Checks 3 and 4's file
half run only when an evidence folder is given: then every crop file must
exist and hash to its recorded value. Without it they check the recorded
values alone.

A receipt that is not the expected shape raises MalformedReceipt (the CLI
prints "Malformed receipt: <why>" and exits 1).
