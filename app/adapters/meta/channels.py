"""Capture and the pixel channel: the two inputs the decision engine compares.

The engine never talks to a browser or a model directly. It takes a `Capture`
(what the page code says + a screenshot) and a `PixelChannel` (what the pixels
show, via SAM + Spark). Both are interfaces, so the same decision logic runs
against:

  - real captures from Playwright + real SAM 3.1 / Spark   (SamSparkChannel)
  - deterministic fixtures, for tests and the offline demo (FixtureChannel)

This separation is also the honesty of the design: the pixel channel is
independent of the DOM, so text the page hides or paints can never reach the
engine pre-labelled as safe.

REQUIRED_REGIONS and CONFIDENCE_MIN are the knobs behind the cannot_verify
rule: if SAM cannot find amount, address and the confirm button with at least
CONFIDENCE_MIN, the engine blocks.
