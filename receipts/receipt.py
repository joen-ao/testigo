"""Build and sign a receipt, in the spec's shape.

A receipt records one action: the policy it ran under, the approved evidence
crops, the executed crops, how it was approved, and an Ed25519 signature over
everything else. The crop hashes are the same sha256 the interceptor used, so
the number on the receipt is the number that was checked.

Hashes prove the evidence files were not swapped; they cannot say whether two
captures show the same thing (SAM's boxes move a few pixels between captures,
and the review screen has another layout). So a receipt also records the text
read from each crop (`read`) and the comparison of those values
(`comparison`). Receipts without `read` compare by hash.

The signature covers the canonical content (every field except `signature`),
which includes `pubkey`. Trust comes from pinning that public key out of band;
`testigo verify --pubkey <hex>` does exactly that.
