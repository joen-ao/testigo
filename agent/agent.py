"""Wonder, the agent. It observes a frame and proposes the next action.

  WonderAgent    the real agent: Muse Wonder over the Responses API with our own
                 `function` tools (F3-D5). Wonder does not accept Meta's
                 `computer` tool with our keys (gate g1, 31 Oct), so the tools
                 below play that role and every call comes back to our code.
  parse_action   the single seam that turns an API response into our actions.

The offline scripted agent used by unit tests lives in tests/fixtures/.

An action is a small dict the loop understands:
  {"kind": "click", "x": 838, "y": 722}          pixels of the 1280x800 capture
  {"kind": "double_click", "x": .., "y": ..}
  {"kind": "type", "text": "..."}
  {"kind": "keypress", "keys": ["Enter"]}
  {"kind": "scroll", "x": .., "y": .., "dy": 400}
  {"kind": "wait"}
  {"kind": "done", "rationale": "..."}           the agent says it finished
  {"kind": "confirm", "address_text": .., "amount_cents": ..}   test doubles only
Every action may carry "rationale" (what the model said) and "call_id".
