"""The supervised loop: agent -> TESTIGO+ -> browser.

Its one invariant: in a supervised run, every action the agent proposes passes
through `interceptor.check` before the driver can execute it, and every payment
is re-checked with `interceptor.verify` after the click.

With supervised=False the interceptor is removed entirely (spec row 3 / View
3): the agent acts directly and no receipt is kept.

The driver and agent are passed in. Unit tests use the doubles in
tests/fixtures/fake_agent.py; real runs use Playwright and Wonder (F3).

Every event also goes to `sink` (F11): the interceptor service relays it to the
interface. The sink is best effort and never changes the outcome.
