"""Gate g2: every action Wonder proposes passes the hook before the browser (F0 §13).

  .venv/bin/python -m gate.g2_intercept_wonder [--min-actions 10] [--max-runs 15]

Repeats the supervised `clean` task with the real Wonder and Chromium until at
least --min-actions actions were proposed, and counts how many passed through
the loop's hook before reaching Playwright. Passes when the two counts are
equal and reach the minimum (10 of 10).

g2 only counts the hook, so it runs without the pixel models (no spend on
them): a click on the confirm button is blocked with cannot_verify, and each run
usually contributes one action. Wonder's raw answers
and each run's outcome go to runs/gate/<date>/g2/.
