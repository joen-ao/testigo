"""F5: does a line of divergent text look like an instruction for the agent?

The divergence check finds text that is in one channel (page code / pixels) and
not the other. Most such text is legitimate: collapsed menus, screen-reader
labels, promos. Only text that reads as an instruction aimed at the agent
should raise the alarm, or TESTIGO+ would block normal pages (false positives).

A line is flagged if it has any of these signals (F5-D1):
  - a street address (number + street name + Road/Street/Avenue/...; a line
    carrying an address that appears in only one channel is suspicious
    whatever the address);
  - a term that addresses an agent together with a delivery or confirmation
    verb (or a change of the delivery address).

Agent terms and verbs are matched in English, and also in Spanish (kept as
defence in depth; the scenario is in English).

Known limit (F5-D4): an instruction written without any of these signals would
not be flagged. It is assumed and measured (a WitnessBench case), not hidden.
