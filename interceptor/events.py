"""Events the interceptor emits to the interface.

One JSON object per event. These constructors fix the contract from the spec;
if a field changes, it changes here first. The interface (WebSocket/SSE) and
WitnessBench both read these shapes.

Event types:
  run.started         a run began (mode supervised|no_supervisor, scenario)
  agent.step          the agent proposed or completed a step
  frame.captured      a screenshot was taken
  check.result        the pre-action verdict (ok|divergence|policy_violation|cannot_verify)
  approval.requested  a payment that passed checks now needs the person
  approval.granted    the person approved (voice + passkey)
  verify.result       the after-the-click comparison (match|mismatch)
  receipt.signed      the signed receipt was written
  payment.executed    what the portal recorded as paid (both modes; view 3)

Optional fields added by F11 (absent until the producer has them):
  frame.captured.image        screenshot path, relative to runs/
  approval.requested.images   {"amount": path, "recipient": path} crop PNGs
  verify.result.images        {"approved": {...}, "executed": {...}} crop PNGs
  receipt.signed.path         receipt.json path, relative to runs/

check.result.status is one of: ok, divergence, policy_violation, cannot_verify.
When status is ok and the action is a payment, the engine follows it with an
approval.requested; a non-payment ok action is simply allowed.
