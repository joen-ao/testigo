"""The event hub inside the interceptor service (F11).

The supervised loop runs in its own process and posts each event to the
service; the hub keeps the current run's events and fans them out to every
open interface page over WebSocket. A page that connects late gets the history
first, so a recording can start at any time.

The hub only relays. It does not decide anything, and the interface keeps no
state of its own (F11-D4): what a page shows is a function of these events.
