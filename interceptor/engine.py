"""The TESTIGO+ decision engine.

Nothing the agent proposes reaches the page without passing through `check`.
The rules run in order; the first that fires decides. This is the piece the
whole demo turns on, so it is kept pure: it takes a Capture and a PixelChannel,
returns events, and talks to no browser, model or network itself.

Rules (spec order):
  1. SAM cannot find amount, address or the confirm button with confidence
        -> cannot_verify, block.
  2. Text in the page code that is not drawn, or drawn text not in the code
        -> divergence, block.
  3. Delivery address or total read from the pixels breaks the policy
        -> policy_violation, block.
  4. Everything agrees and the action confirms the order
        -> needs approval (voice + passkey).
  5. After the click, executed crops differ from the approved crops
        -> mismatch, the receipt is flagged.

"Read from the pixels" everywhere: the address and amount used for the policy
check come from the pixel channel, never from the DOM, so a hidden or swapped
value cannot slip an order through.
